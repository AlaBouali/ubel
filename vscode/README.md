# UBEL — Supply-Chain Firewall

**Multi-ecosystem security scanner for the developer's machine and tools.**  
Covers source repos, developer machines, zero cloud calls except for osv.dev and NVD API.

## What is UBEL?

UBEL is a **software composition analysis (SCA)** tool and **install-blocking firewall** built for teams who care about what enters their supply chain at every layer. Unlike report-only scanners, UBEL enforces policy — if a scan fails, it blocks the operation and tells you exactly why.

It spans the entire delivery chain: from the moment a developer adds a dependency, through CI validation, to what is running on a deployment server or inside an AI agent's runtime environment.

## Extension's features

- Full dependency resolution with PURL generation
- Vulnerability scanning via batched API queries to OSV.dev and NVD's APIs
- Concurrent vulnerability enrichment (CVSS, fix recommendations, references)
- Policy engine — block/allow by severity threshold and unknown-severity packages
- Malicious package (infection) detection — always blocked regardless of policy
- Dependency graph with introduced-by and parent tracking
- Automatic report generation: timestamped **JSON** + **HTML** + **SBOM** per scan, plus `latest.*` convenience links
- Zero external runtime dependencies (Node.js stdlib only)
- Complete compliant, and enriched SBOM Cyclonedx V1.6 files with full dependencies and vulnerabilities data in VEX.

## Coverage at a Glance

| Surface | Mode | Toolchain |
|---|---|---|
| Source repos & monorepos | Scan + firewall | npm, pnpm, bun, pip |
| Developer machines (Windows / Linux) | Scan | System packages, runtimes, browsers, tools |
| VS Code | Scan extensions | walk through the extensions folder |

---

## Policy

All package managers share the same policy engine. Policy is stored per-project in `.ubel/local/policy/config.json`.

| Field | Values | Default | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| `severity_threshold` | `low` `medium` `high` `critical` `none` | `high` | Block packages at or above this severity |
| `block_unknown_vulnerabilities` | `true` `false` | `true` | Block packages with CVEs but no CVSS score |
| Infections (`MAL-*`) | — | always blocked | Cannot be toggled; unconditionally blocked |

The threshold is inclusive — `high` blocks both `high` and `critical`. Setting `none` disables severity blocking but infections are still blocked.

### Repos and Monorepos

UBEL walks the entire directory tree and detects all supported ecosystems in a single pass — no per-language configuration needed. Monorepos with mixed stacks (e.g. a Node.js frontend, Python backend, and Rust service in the same repo) are fully covered in one invocation.

### Developer Machines

The VS Code extension (`Ctrl+Alt+P`) and the `ubel-platform` CLI binary scan the host machine: OS, installed runtimes, browsers, developer tools, and security software. Vulnerabilities are matched using CPE 2.3 identifiers against the CVE/NVD database.

This surface catches what dependency scanners miss — a vulnerable version of Git, an unpatched Python interpreter, or an outdated Docker Desktop install.


### Windows

Detected via registry probes and PowerShell — no elevated privileges required.

| Category | Components |
|---|---|
| Operating system | Windows 10 / 11 (build-accurate CPE version) |
| Security | Windows Defender |
| Runtimes | Node.js, Python, PHP, Go, Rust, Ruby, JRE, JDK |
| .NET | All installed .NET Core / Desktop / ASP.NET runtimes (multi-version) |
| Browsers | Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge |
| Developer tools | Git, Docker Desktop, VS Code, Cursor |
| Shell | PowerShell |

### Linux

Detected by reading the system package database directly.

| Distro family | Package manager | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Debian / Ubuntu | dpkg | `/var/lib/dpkg/status` |
| Alpine | apk | `/lib/apk/db/installed` |
| Red Hat / AlmaLinux / Rocky | rpm | `rpm -qa` |

> On RPM-based systems, `rpm -qa` may return partial results depending on SELinux policy if run without elevated privileges.

## Supported Ecosystems (Project Scan)

| Ecosystem | Package Manager | Resolved From |
|---|---|---|
| **Node.js** | npm, pnpm, yarn, bun | `node_modules/` (on-disk walk) |
| **Python** | pip / virtualenv | `.venv`, `venv`, virtual environment directories |
| **PHP** | Composer | `vendor/` |
| **Rust** | Cargo | `Cargo.lock` |
| **Go** | Go Modules | `go.sum` |
| **C#/.NET** | NuGet | `packages.lock.json` / `obj/project.assets.json` |
| **Java/Kotlin** | Maven | `pom.xml` resolved dependencies |
| **Ruby** | Bundler | `Gemfile.lock` |

---

## Reports

Every scan writes a self-contained interactive **HTML** + **JSON** + **SBOM** reports.

| Scan target | Report path |
|---|---|
| Workspace | `<project-root>/.ubel/reports/latest*` |
| VS Code extensions | `~/.vscode/extensions/.ubel/reports/latest*` |
| Host platform | `~/.ubel/reports/latest*` |

Previous scans are retained under:

- `<project-root>/.ubel/local/reports/npm/health/<year>/<month>/<day>/`
- `~/.vscode/extensions/.ubel/local/reports/npm/health/<year>/<month>/<day>/`
- `~/.ubel/local/reports/npm/health/<year>/<month>/<day>/`

---

## Requirements

- Node.js `>=18.0.0`
- Python `>=3.9` (for `ubel-pip`, `ubel-apt`, `ubel-dnf`)
- VS Code `^1.85.0` (extension only)
